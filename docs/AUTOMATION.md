# Automation Overview & Usage Guide

This project is equipped with advanced automation to ensure reliability, security, and ease of development.

## Automated Workflows

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **What it does:**
  - Builds, lints, tests, checks for broken links, and audits security on every push or pull request.
- **How to use:**
  - Just push code to `main` or open a pull request. The workflow runs automatically.

### 2. Auto-Fix Agent
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/auto-fix.yml`
- **What it does:**
  - Automatically fixes lint, formatting, and security issues, then commits and pushes fixes.
- **How to use:**
  - Push code to `main`. The agent will run and auto-fix common issues.

### 3. Deployment Automation
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **What it does:**
  - Deploys the app to Vercel on every push to `main`.
- **How to use:**
  - Add your Vercel secrets to the repository settings. Push code to `main` to trigger deployment.

### 4. Failure Notifications
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/notify.yml`
- **What it does:**
  - Sends Slack notifications if CI/CD or deployment fails.
- **How to use:**
  - Add your Slack webhook to repository secrets. Youâ€™ll get notified automatically on failures.

## How to Configure Secrets
- Go to your GitHub repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
- Add the following secrets as needed:
  - `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` (for deployment)
  - `SLACK_WEBHOOK` (for notifications)

---

## Best Practices
- Always commit and push code to trigger automation.
- Check Actions tab in GitHub for workflow status and logs.
- Fix any issues reported by automation or let the auto-fix agent handle them.
- Keep secrets up to date for smooth deployments and notifications.
